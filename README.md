Description of the project:

We have data of extraction and purification of gold ore. The aim is to develop a model that optimizes production and eliminate unprofitable parameters. Steps will be the following:
- Preprocess the data and verify that the recovery calculations are correct.
- Analyze the data by exploring the metal distributions and feed particle size.
- Create a predictive model to establish the amount of gold extracted from the gold ore, taking into account the waste and concentrates produced at each stage of the process.
- Train different models and evaluate them using the sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error) metric and cross-validation.

The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.

In this repository you can find the rar with .csv file to perform this analysis.
